## What Worked, and What Didn't

Broadly Compared is a bitesize project that I did over two days. Here is what worked and what didn't:

:white_check_mark: Material UI: The screenshots accompanying the document detailing the instructions for the app showed that a lot of bits and pieces were using Material UI, which I only had a cursory knowledge of. So it was interesting to learn how it all works; overall, it's pretty straightforward and quite easy to make something look good. It looks a little more stylistically consistent than the project I finished a couple of days before (CryptoGecko, also available on my GitHub) even though I didn't have to put as much effort into it.

:x: CSS accuracy: The project brief stated there was no need to imitate the screenshots attached; still, the project was simple enough on the "logic" side that I wanted to practice my CSS a bit more and stick to the original site as much as possible. Unfortunately, this took quite a while, and I wasn't able to 100% match the original design by the deadline I had set myself.

Overall, though, the project went quite well and was a nice change of pace from my latest projects that were more code-heavy.
